    <h1>Croissant</h1>
    <p>
      Croissant, pronounced khru-ah-son, is a type of puff pastry thatâ€™s light,
      buttery and flaky. It derives its name from its shape, as croissant means
      crescent in French. Though this flaky pastry is often associated with
      France, and is a staple in most French boulangeries (bakeries), food
      historians place its origins in Austria and believe that it was introduced
      to France in the 19th century by two Austrian bakers.
